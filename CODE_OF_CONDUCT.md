# Vibegram Community Guidelines

## Our Philosophy

Vibegram is built by developers, for developers. We believe great software emerges from collaboration, mutual respect, and open exchange of ideas.

## Expected Behavior

**Be constructive.** When reviewing code or discussing ideas, focus on the work, not the person. Suggest improvements rather than just pointing out flaws.

**Be inclusive.** Welcome newcomers. Remember that everyone was a beginner once. Answer questions patiently and point people to resources.

**Be professional.** Disagreements happen in technical discussions. Keep debates focused on technical merit. Avoid personal attacks, trolling, or inflammatory language.

**Be accountable.** If you make a mistake, own it. If someone points out an issue with your contribution, address it constructively.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks of any kind
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Sustained disruption of discussions or contributions
- Any conduct that would be inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

These guidelines apply to all Vibegram spaces: GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other community channels.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may remove, edit, or reject contributions that violate these guidelines. Repeated or severe violations may result in temporary or permanent bans.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please open an issue or contact the maintainers directly. All reports will be handled with discretion.

## Attribution

These guidelines are adapted for the Vibegram project and inspired by various open source community standards.
